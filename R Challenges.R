# This collection of R programming problems is designed to challenge you. As you solve these problems, you may ask yourself "Well... how did I get here?", "How do I work this?", or "My God! What have I done?", so be sure to use all of the resources at your disposal. This includes the help files in R, google, your friends, downloadable packages, previous TURF meetings, or any other ideas you can think of. Learning R is an experimental process that you learn by doing, and the purpose of this exercise is for you to jump in and start "doing".

# Feel free to pick and choose the problems appropriate to your skill level. They are organized roughly in order of increasing difficulty. And remember that there is no one way to solve a problem in R!


# Biology Problem -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For this problem we will use the CO2 data that is included in R. You can display this data frame in the console by entering the command "CO2". 

# First, add the CO2 data frame to your environment.

# Make a boxplot to explore if there is a difference in CO2 uptake between different plant types.

# How about the difference between different treatments?

# Use an ANOVA to test whether any of the plants took up less CO2 when chilled.


# Psychology Problem --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For this problem, we will use the attitude data that is located in the datasets library. 

# First, load the datasets library.

# Now add the attitude data to your environment.

# This data reports employee evaluations of their supervisors. Each column represents a quality being evaluated, and each column represents a different supervisor. 

# The evaluated qualities are: 
# Overall supervisor performance
# Ability to handle complaints
# Does not allow special privileges
# Offers learning opportunities
# Gives performance based raises
# Is overly critical of performance
# Advances employees rapidly

# Which quality best predicts the outcome of column 1 (Overall supervisor performance)?

# Make a figure demonstrating the relationship between the predictor and the outcome.

# Save this figure so that you can open it outside of R.


# Math Problem --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Make a Fibonaci sequence that is 10 numbers long.

# What is the sum of the numbers in the sequence?

# Plot each numeral against its inverse, using a line.


# Spatial Data Problem ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For this problem we will use the quakes data included in R. 

# Add the quakes data to your environment.

# Subset the data frame to just latitude and longitude. 

# Make a plot of locations where earthquakes have occured. 

# Export this data to a format that can be interpreted by a GIS program (a shapefile).


# Data Organization Problem -------------------------------------------------------------------

# For this problem we will use the UCBAdmissions table that is included in R.

# First, add the UCBAdmissions table to your environment.

# Examine this table. Reorganize the table so that you see only the number of admitted students for each department by gender. Your table should resemble this example:

# Dept.   Gender   Number
# A       Male     512
# A       Female   89
# B       Male     353 
# and so on
